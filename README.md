# sunday-school-attendance-tracker

I want to create a website that takes attendance for sundayschool classes. Each teacher should have a login and must be able to maintain the data for their class. The admin account must be able to view all data as well as maintain and grant access. There must be a page for admin functions. Each student must have a set of attributes like name surname telephone number and any additional attributes must be easy to add. The data must be secure
